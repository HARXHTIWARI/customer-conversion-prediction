# Customer Conversion Prediction Using Decision Tree & Logistic Regression

## ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

This project focuses on predicting customer conversion using two machine learning models: **Decision Tree** and **Logistic Regression**. The dataset is based on customer demographics and marketing campaign interactions. The models help to predict whether a customer will respond positively to a given marketing campaign.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

- **Project Title**: Customer Conversion Prediction
- **Technologies**: Python, Machine Learning (Decision Tree, Logistic Regression)
- **Tools**: Google Colab, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Data Source**: The dataset consists of customer details and their interaction with previous marketing campaigns.
  
The project includes:
- Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Building and comparing the performance of Decision Tree and Logistic Regression models
- Prediction based on user input
