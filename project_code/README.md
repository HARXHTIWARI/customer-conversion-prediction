## Overview
This folder contains the core code for the project, including the Jupyter Notebook that performs both data preprocessing and machine learning model training.

## Files
- **`Customer_Conversion_Prediction.ipynb`**:  
  This Jupyter notebook includes the following:
  - **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, transforming, and preparing the data for modeling.
  - **Model Training**: Implementation of Decision Tree and Logistic Regression models for customer conversion prediction.
  - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualization and analysis of the dataset to extract meaningful insights.
  - **Model Evaluation**: Performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## Usage
To run the project:
1. Open `Customer_Conversion_Prediction.ipynb` in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run the cells in sequence to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance.

Make sure you have all necessary dependencies installed if running locally, such as:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`
